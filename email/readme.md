# Notes on Pi-Gatway
The pigate unit has the following roles:
- Connect to the inertnet of things to get and send messages for the rest of the pies at home.
- Send messages or interact with the other pies.
- Chaperon. This application checks to see when I am home and keeps track of me. Checks with me if not on schedule.
- tweets status, reminders and other information to it's tweeter account.
